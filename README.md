Basic Card Submission Guidelines:

-Must have a working card script, card database, and pictures. We will not take requests to be scripted for you here. Request go to this hub: https://github.com/Gideon9212/Custom_Requests

-Card ID's must start with 210xxxxxx (9 numbers total, first 3 starting with 210. Few exceptions will be made. 10 or more will cause overflow.)

-Make sure said card ID's are not stepping in another creater's ID range. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NHbQuzu9SBOuFfz4tr1cqHEY7NER0BfAZ_BOOYt7Dd8/edit#gid=0

-Custom setcodes must start with fxx (x being the numbers. If you want to do f1, do f01 please)
Check setcode list here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QEB79bUre_l6NMFjbhDKRACkrJs0Pz23IZVFMj3chM0/edit#gid=0

-Custom summons or attributes are not allowed. We are not modifying the core for your customs. Custom types are still allowed.

-Cards should have a "+0" effect on card advantage, except with extreme costs or conditions. (Even then, chances are low to be added)

-No "instant win" conditions unless it is creative and balanced.

-Card text must follow PCST standards, as of Series 9 or higher (for example, we accept either "graveyard" or "GY", but it must be consistent.)

-Card pictures must be SFW. Picture resolution must be 177x254 and in JPG format for card proxies, 512x512 in PNG for field images.

-Cards must be original - do not submit copies of anime cards. In addition, do not design your card to work with anime cards, as they are not on the custom server and will not be available to play with.

-Cards must pass review by Gideon, passing both these guidelines and a general evaluation of balance.

-When your card passes, please put just the artwork here: https://github.com/Gideon9212/CustomArtwork

(Rules subject to change.)

Balance Tips

Ask yourself these questions when designing the card.

Is your card strictly better than something that has seen play in the past few formats?

Is it very similar to something that's currently Limited or Forbidden?

If you were the opponent, would you have a major problem trying to play around or get rid of this card?

Can it cause an OTK, starting from a nearly empty field?

If the answer to any of these questions is "Yes", consider toning down the effect or applying restrictions.
If you're in doubt, just tone it down yourself.
